🌟 Coders of DELHI 🚀

My First Project in the Data Science Journey

📌 Project Overview

Coders of DELHI is my first data science project where I explored data loading, cleaning, processing, and friend recommendation algorithms using Pandas in Python with Excel-formatted data.

The project simulates a real-world social networking platform by:

Managing users, friends, and liked pages

Cleaning and standardizing messy datasets

Implementing a “People You May Know” feature based on mutual connections

🛠 Features
🔹 Data Loading & Display

Loaded Excel dataset using Pandas

Displayed structured user details, friend connections, and liked pages

🔹 Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicate friend entries

Filtered out inactive users (no friends + no liked pages)

Removed duplicate page IDs

🔹 People You May Know

Suggested potential friends using mutual friend analysis

Ranked friend recommendations based on the number of shared connections

Mimicked how real social networks recommend connections
